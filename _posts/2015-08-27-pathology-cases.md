## Case 1

Clinical History: 

A 30-year-old [African American woman](http://www.lupusny.org/about-lupus/who-gets-lupus) presented to her family physician with nonradiating chest pain, shortness of breath, fever, weight-loss, malaise, lethargy and arthralgia.  She exhibited an [erythematous skin rash](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/49272502/temp%20images/small%20group%201/image1.jpeg) involving areas of the body exposed to sunlight. She noticed hair loss during the months prior to seeking medical attention.  She was admitted to the hospital for observation and tests.

Laboratory Findings and X-Ray:  
A chest X-ray revealed cardiomegaly and [pleural effusion](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/49272502/temp%20images/small%20group%201/Screenshot%202015-08-27%2022.29.18.png).  A complete blood count (CBC) identified a normochromic, normocytic anemia.  Urinalysis revealed [hematuria, proteinuria and erythrocyte and leukocyte casts](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/49272502/temp%20images/small%20group%201/Screenshot%202015-08-27%2022.27.33.png).  Analysis of the blood serum revealed the presence of autoantibodies against double-stranded DNA (p127).  [Immunofluorescence staining](http://images.rheumatology.org/viewphoto.php?albumId=75690&imageId=2862319) for antinuclear antibodies showed a [peripheral pattern](http://www.thelupussite.com/lupus_diagnosis_tests/ana_antinuclear_antibody.html) using human leukocytes as the substrate.  The serum also contained [rheumatoid factor](http://www.healthline.com/health-slideshow/lupus-and-ra#1) and [anticytoplasmic antibodies](http://www.cidjournal.com/article/0738-081X%2885%2990074-4/abstract). 

Clinical Course of Disease:
A renal biopsy was performed and revealed diffuse [proliferative glomerulonephritis](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/49272502/temp%20images/small%20group%201/Screenshot%202015-08-27%2022.29.18.png) characterized by extensive cellular proliferation in more than 50% of glomeruli.  Immune complexes were deposited mainly in a [subendothelial distribution](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/49272502/temp%20images/small%20group%201/Screenshot%202015-08-27%2022.29.18.png).  Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that the immune deposits stained positively for all three major immunoglobulin classes and complement indicating a polyclonal activation of the immune system.  [Electron microscopy](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/49272502/temp%20images/small%20group%201/Screenshot%202015-08-27%2022.29.18.png) confirmed the subendothelial as well as intramembranous deposition of immune deposits.

### 2.	Why did this patient present with chest pain?

The patient may suffer [Libman-Sacks endocarditis](p 89 & p 130), possiblely related Thrombi, which can develop anywhere in the cardiovascular system due to [lupus anticoagulant](http://www.hopkinslupus.org/lupus-tests/antiphospholipid-antibodies/) which increases the ability of the blood to clot.

### 3. What are the major immunologic features of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)?

**from SLE ppt slide 15** 

Positive LE cell preparation. 
Anti-DNA. Antibody to native DNA, Anti-Sm. Presence of AB to Smith nuclear antigen. 
False-positive serologic test for syphilis known to be positive for at least 6 months and confirmed by TPI or FTA test.

**from book Immunologic Abnormalities on page 126**

Type 1 interferons
TLR signals
Failure of B cell tolerance


### 4. Is lupus more likely to occur in males or females and in Caucasians or African Americans?

More likely to occur in [females](http://www.lupusny.org/about-lupus/who-gets-lupus) and in African Americans. 


### 5.What are lupus anti-coagulants and anti-phospholipid antibodies and what role do they play in the pathogenesis of SLE?

Antiphospholipid antibodies are present in 40% to 50% of patients with lupus and react with a wide variety of proteins in complex with phospholipids. Some bind to cardiolipin antigen, used in serologic tests for syphilis, so patients with lupus may have a false-positive test result for syphilis. Antiphos- pholipid antibodies contribute to coagulation abnormalities (p127)

Paradoxically, these antibodies interfere with clotting tests and are actually called “lupus anticoagulants.” Autoantibodies are also produced against clotting factors such as thrombin, and these too may contribute to clotting disorders. the term Lupus -anti-coagulants are actually a [misnomer](http://www.hopkinslupus.org/lupus-tests/antiphospholipid-antibodies/)


### 6. What does a biopsy of the erythematous skin rash involving areas of the body exposed to sunlight reveal?

Histopathologic findings include **liquefactive degeneration** of the basal layer of the epidermis, **edema** at the dermoepidermal junction, and [mononuclear infiltrates](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/49272502/temp%20images/small%20group%201/image2.jpeg) around blood vessels and skin appendages. also see [figure](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/49272502/temp%20images/small%20group%201/image3.jpeg) Immunofluorescence microscopy reveals deposition of immunoglobulin and complement at the [dermoepidermal junction](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/49272502/temp%20images/small%20group%201/Screenshot%202015-08-27%2023.27.19.png)

### 7. What percentage of patients with SLE has renal involvement?  

Although the kidney appears normal by light microscopy in 25% to 30% of cases, almost all cases of SLE show some renal abnormality if examined by immuno- fluorescence and electron microscopy.(p128)

### 8.	Why did the patient develop exacerbations and remissions?


### 9.	Why does a SLE patient have rheumatoid factors in the serum?

Because in lupus, the immune system attacks the body, including the joints. Rheumatoid factor is an antibody that becomes connected to another type of antibody called immunoglobulin. Together, these form an immune complex that can become involved in inflammation.

### 10.	What is the differential diagnosis of SLE?

* MNEMONIC  DOPAMIN RASH

* DISCOID RASH

* ORAL ULCERS

* PHOTOSENSITIVITY

* ANA

* MALAR RASH

* IMMUNOLOGICAL PHENOMENON(Le Cell, Ds DNA, Sm, APL ab, false + RPR, )

* NEUROLOGICAL(Seizures,Psychosis)

* RENAL(Nephrotic,Nephritic)

* ARTHRITIS	

* SEROSITIS

* HEMATOLOGICAL(Leukopenia,Thrombocytopenia, anemia)

* [slide 16 from sle ppt](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/49272502/temp%20images/small%20group%201/Screenshot%202015-08-27%2022.38.42.png)

### 11. What are the complications and prognosis of SLE?

Prognosis

 A primary cause of death among patients with lupus is atherosclerosis and SLE is unpredictable and varies greatly form one individual to the next.

Mild SLE. 

* skin rashes of discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) or subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE) with or without joint aches. 

Widespread SLE. 

* SLE is a chronic, life-long disease, alternating between periods of symptom relapse, (called flares), and remission. The disease 

may begin in any of the various systems of the body and progress unpredictably to others. 

The following are typical patterns:

* Symptom relapses, or flares, occur on the average of two or three times a year.
* Between flares, most patients with SLE function at about 90% of normal capacity.

The degree of severity depends on different factors:

* Severity of the inflammatory response
* Frequency of episodes
* The degree of organ or system involvement

Vital organs or systems,joints, skin, and others are affected. 

Infections followed by kidney failure are the chief causes of death in patients with SLE.

### 12.	What is the five-year survival rate of patients with SLE?

About 95% in the US, see the [table](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/49272502/temp%20images/Screenshot%202015-08-27%2014.20.33.png)

## Case 2

### CLINICAL HISTORY:  

A 45-year-old white male previously diagnosed with a T cell leukemia developed skin rash, severe diarrhea and jaundice after receiving repeated blood transfusions.  The skin exhibited a fine, diffuse, erythematous, macular rash that began on the palms, soles and head and spread to the entire trunk as well as to extremities.  The rash became desquamative and resembled an extensive second-degree burn.  There was watery diarrhea associated with malabsorption, cramps and gastrointestinal bleeding.  Blood chemistry analysis revealed [hyperbilirubinemia](p139) and an elevated serum alkaline phosphatase level.  There was only a mild elevation in the alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase levels (AST).

### 1.	Are the clinical events described above attributable to the leukemia process or to some other factor?
To some other factor. 

### 2.	What is the most likely cause of the signs and symptoms described in this patient?  
graft-versus-host diseases

### 3. How could a leukemia patient in hospital develop signs and symptoms of graft-versus-host disease?
GVHD occurs when immunologically competent cells are introduced into an immunoincompetent host. GVHD refers to the immunologic insult and to the consequences to the organism. The patient must have had a Hematopoietic cell transplation, Solid organ transplants, or blood transfusions.

### 4. What is the mechanism of the skin rash?
**from textbook**
It resemble those of SS (p139), In the early stages, affected skin areas are somewhat edematous and have a doughy consistency. Capillaries and small arteries (as large as 500 μm in diameter) may show thickening of the basal lamina, endothelial cell damage, and partial occlusion. With progression, the edema- tous phase is replaced by progressive fibrosis of the dermis, which becomes tightly bound to the subcutaneous structures. There is marked increase of compact collagen in the dermis along with thinning of the epidermis, atrophy of the dermal appendages, and hyaline thickening of the walls of dermal arterioles and capillaries (P133)

or 


Skin — In most patients, the first (and most common) clinical manifestation of acute GVHD is a maculopapular rash, usually occurring at or near the time of the white blood cell engraftment (picture 1). The rash initially involves the nape of the neck, ears, shoulders, the palms of the hands (picture 2), and the soles of the feet. It can be described as a sunburn and may be pruritic or painful (picture 3). From these initial areas of presentation, the rash may spread to involve the whole integument, eventually becoming confluent. In severe GVHD, the maculopapular rash forms bullous lesions with toxic epidermal necrolysis mimicking Stevens-Johnson syndrome
[source](http://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-grading-of-acute-graft-versus-host-disease)

### 5. What is the cause of the hyperbilirubinemia
Destruction of small bile ducts gives rise to jaundice, thus resulted in hyperbilirubinemia

### 6. What subset of T lymphocytes is found in biopsies of skin, intestine and liver?
CD 4+ and CD 8+

### 7. How could graft-versus-host disease be prevented in patients receiving blood transfusions?
GVHD is a potentially lethal complication that can be minimized but not eliminated by HLA matching. As another potential solution, donor T cells can be depleted before marrow transplant. 

### 8. When is graft-versus-host disease most often observed?

* Degree of mismatch between HLA types
* “minor” histocompatibility antigens   
* Age – possible thymic influence
* Germ free environment
* Pre-treatment with cytotoxic drugs
* Sex mismatch
* Transfusion presensitization 


9.	What types of GVH disease follow bone marrow transplantation?
The small bowel and colon are involved in most cases. Intestinal graft-versus-host disease often manifests as a watery diarrhea.

## Case 3

### CLINICAL HISTORY: 

A 60-year-old white male presented to his family physician with complaints of weakness, anorexia, weight loss and severe back pain.

###LABORATORY AND X-RAY FINDINGS:  

Radiologic examination revealed  "punched out" [skeletal lesions]() with sharply demarcated margins in vertebral bodies, skull, ribs, and pelvis.  Blood chemistry showed hypercalcemia and hyperglobulinemia.  The serum globulin concentration was [6.0 g/dl](http://www.drstandley.com/labvalues_proteins.shtml).  Both the serum and urine revealed a homogeneous protein by electrophoresis, which was identified as [IgA](p437).  The urine contained free light chains.  The urinary protein was insoluble at acid pH between [40º and 60ºC but redissolved at 95ºC.](http://basicprotein.blogspot.com/2012/11/tests-for-detection-of-bence-jones.html) 

Hematologic examination revealed a normochromic normocytic anemia with leukopenia and thrombocytopenia.  The blood smear revealed rouleaux formation of red cells.  There was an elevated sedimentation rate and marked plasma cell proliferation in the bone marrow.   Flow cytometric analysis of the bone marrow revealed an abnormal CD45 negative cell population that expressed CD38, CD56 and CD138 with cytoplasmic kappa light chain restriction.  This cell population was negative for CD19, CD20 and surface immunoglobulin.

A renal biopsy was performed and revealed large numbers of eosinophilic lamellated casts in the renal tubules.  The tubular cells were markedly atrophic and contained hyaline droplets and some crystalline material. The glomeruli appeared normal, yet they were surrounded by interstitial fibrosis as a result of tubular destruction.  The patient received supportive therapy including local radiation therapy to relieve pain.  He experienced repeated bouts of respiratory infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae.  After reaching a diagnosis, cytotoxic therapy was instituted, yet the patient died within 12 months of diagnosis.


### 1. What information provided above is of the greatest assistance in reaching a diagnosis of plasma cell 	(multiple) myeloma in this patient?


### 2. Why did this patient present with severe back pain?
It is due to pathologic fractures. Pathologic fractures of vertebrae may lead to spinal cord impingement, an oncologic emergency.

### 3. What is the cause of the "punched out" osteolytic lesions?

Bone destruction by osteolytic lesions is caused by two separate events. Rapid growth of myeloma cells inhibits normal bone-forming cells, damaging bone. In addition, production of substances that activate the cells that resorb bone, called osteoclasts, is increased. 

The lesions generally arise in the medullary cavity, erode cancellous bone, and progressively destroy the cortical bone.


### 4. What is the significance of the light chain proteinuria described in this patient.  
 Light chain deposition in the glomeruli or the interstitium, either as amyloid or linear deposits, also may contribute to renal dysfunction.

### 5. Since the patient was hypergammaglobulinemic, why did he suffer repeated bouts of pneumococcal infection?

Patients with myeloma are immunosuppressed. Through uncertain mechanisms, myeloma cells interfere with the function of normal plasma cells, leading to defects in antibody production. Thus, although the plasma usually contains increased immunoglobulin owing to the pres- ence of an M protein, the levels of functional antibodies often are profoundly depressed, leaving patients at high risk for bacterial infections. (p438)

### 6. Which part of the skeletal system is most frequently affected in plasma cell myeloma?

Multiple myeloma usually manifests with multifocal destructive skeletal lesions, which most commonly involve the vertebral column, ribs, skull, pelvis, femur, clavicle, and scapula. The lesions generally arise in the medullary cavity, erode cancellous bone, and progressively destroy the cortical bone.

### 7. What is the differential diagnosis of plasma cell 	myeloma?

The main differential is that of widespread bony metastases. Findings that favour the diagnosis of bony metastases over that of multiple myeloma include:

* more commonly affect the vertebral pedicles rather than vertebral bodies
* rarely involve mandible, distal axial skeleton
* although both entities have variable bone scan appearances (both hot and cold) unlike myeloma, extensive bony metastases rarely have a normal appearance

Other rare entities include:

* Waldenstrom macroglonulinaemia

[source](http://radiopaedia.org/articles/multiple-myeloma-1)

### 8. Which immunoglobulins may be increased in plasma cell myeloma?

he most frequent M protein produced by myeloma cells is IgG (60%), followed by IgA (20% to 25%); only rarely are IgM, IgD, or IgE M proteins observed.

### 9. Do all cases of plasma cell myeloma have the monoclonal serum paraprotein identifiable 	electrophoresis?

Electrophoresis of the serum and urine is an important diagnostic tool. In 99% of cases, either a monoclonal com- plete immunoglobulin or a monoclonal free immunoglobu- lin light chain is present in the serum, the urine, or both

Because these immunoglobulins can be detected in the serum, these disorders are also referred to as monoclonal gammopathies, and the associated immuno- globulin is often referred to as an M protein
