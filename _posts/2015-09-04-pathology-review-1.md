### Inflammation and Repair


myeloperoxidase

* present in neutrophils

* converts H2O2 into HOCl–

* antimicrobial agent.



lack of β2 integrin

* Inadequate adhesion on cytokine-activated endothelium

<!--break-->

Monocytes

* transform to macrophages, contain(iNOS), which generates NO, NO has antimicrobial activity. 



Activated macrophages produces 

* Interleukin-1 (IL-1)

* (TNF)



neutrophils

* NAPDH oxidase



prostaglandin

* promote vasodilation



interferon-γ

* transform Macrophage to epithelioid cells

* stimulate monocyte 



Leukotriene B4

thromboxane A2

* from plasminogen 

* helps lyse clots



Protein C 

* antagonizes coagulation factor V, in turn stop prothrombin to thrombin



Kallikrein

* generated by activation of Hageman factor (XII) 

* generation of bradykinin and plasmin and C5a



Thrombin

* coagulation cascade.



Fibrin

* end product of coagulation pathways

* forms a meshwork entrapping platelets and creating a plug.



Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)

* Produced by activated macrophages, mediates fever, metabolic wasting, and hypotension.



Bradykinin

* from the kinin system on surface contact of Hageman factor with collagen and basement membrane from vascular injury, vascular permeability, smooth muscle contraction, and pain. 



* Complement C5a 

is chemotactic factor for neutrophils.



complement C3b

* an opsonin may promote phagocytosis



complement C5-9

* membrane attack complex



complement C1q 

* generated in the initial stage of complement activation, eventually result in cell lysis. 



Interleukin-1 (IL-1) 

* produced by activated macrophages

* leukocyte release from bone marrow



Tumor Necrosis factor (TNF)

* produced by activated macrophages

* leukocyte release from bone marrow

* upregulate fibrinogen and SAA





Phospholipase C

* from platelet activation

* release of arachidonic acid



Histamine 

* vasodilator



Commplement activation 

* polysaccharides (alternative pathway) 

* mannose (lectin pathway)

* antibody attached to surface antigens (classic pathway)



Fibroblasts

* chronic inflammatory responses



Mononuclear infiltrates 

* typical of chronic inflammation



Epithelioid cells

* granulomatous inflammation



pyrogens

* TNF

* IL 1



Hageman factor

* initiates the coagulation cascade.



Immunoglobulin E

* in response to inflammatory responses with allergens and with invasive parasites.



Interleukin-12 (IL-12)

* released by macrophages stimulates T-cell responses



SAA

* serum amyloid A 



CRP

* C-reactive protein 



Interleukin-2 (IL-2)

* mediates lymphocyte activation.



IL-5

* activates eosinophils (part of a TH2 response.)



IL-6

* interleukin-6 



IL-10 

* immunosuppressive cytokine -> diminishes lymphocyte activation



IL-17 

* delayed- type hypersensitivity reactions.

* recruiting neutrophils to fight bacterial and fungal infections (aspergillosis and candidiasis)



IL-12

* stimulate NK cells to secrete interferon-γ 



ALT

* Serum Glutamic-Pyruvic Transaminase



AST

* Serum Glutamic-Oxaloacetic Transaminase



fibronectin 

* maintain a cellular scaffolding for growth and repair, and do not contract. 



metalloproteinases

* degradation of collagen and connective tissue remodeling in wound repair



Myofibroblast contraction

* Wound contraction



Integrins 

* interact with the extracellular matrix proteins (e.g. fibronectin)



Platelet-drived growth factor (PDGF)

* mediates migration and proliferation of fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells and migration of monocytes.



Serine proteinases

* are important in wound remodeling.



creatine kinase

* elevated level indicates that myocardial necrosis has occurred. 



### Immune System Diseases



HBsAg

* Surface antigen of the hepatitis B virus (HBV). It indicates current hepatitis B infection.



D8+ T cells 

* binds to the complex of viral peptide and MHC class I mol- ecules displayed on the surface of the infected cell



Natural killer (NK) 

* recognize MHC class I molecules with self-peptides and self-recognition inhibits NK cell killing.



NOD-like receptors (NLRs)

* The nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain receptors



The NLR-inflammasome 

* this pathway plays a role in the innate immune system recognition of urate crystals and promoting the inflammation associated with gout. 

* These receptors may also contribute to inflammation of atherosclerosis.



C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) 

* expressed on the plasma membrane of macrophages and dendritic cells detect fungal glycans and elicit inflammatory reactions to fungi. 



Mannose receptors 

* On phagocytes recognize microbial sugars with terminal mannose residues and induce microbial phagocytosis



RIG-like receptors (RLRs) 

* are located in the cytosol of most cell types and detect nucleic acids of viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm of infected cells to stimulate production of antiviral cytokines. 



Toll-like receptors (TLRs)

* in the plasma membrane and endosomal vesicles activate transcription factors that stimulate synthesis and secretion of cytokines and expression of adhesion molecules to recruit and activate leukocytes.



Neutrophils 

* provide a nonspecific immune response, primarily to bacterial infections and not to intracellular viral infections.



CD16

* Natural killer(NK)cells haveCD16,and Fc receptor



CD19

* B cells have surface immunoglobulin, are CD19 positive, and participate in humoral immunity



CD3

* T lymphocytes, both CD4+ and CD8+. 



CD4

* (TH2) essential to the induction of type I hypersensitivity with cytokines secretion e.g. interleukin (IL)-3, IL-4, IL-5 and macrophage colony-stimulating factor



macrophage colony-stimulating factor

* the growth, recruitment, and activation of mast cells and eosinophils.



Dendritic cells

* trap antigen and aid in antigen presentation.



follicular dendritic cells (FDCs)

* The FDCs may become infected but not killed by HIV. 



Blood monocytes

* expressing MHC classII antigenscan migrate into tissues and become longer-lived macrophages.



Anticardiolipin

* along with anti–β2-glycoprotein “lupus anticoagulant,” 

* found with antiphospholipid syndrome, which may appear in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).



Anti–double-stranded DNA antibodies

* have specificity for SLE



antihistone antibodies 

* are characteristic of drug-induced SLE.
