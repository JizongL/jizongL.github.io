### Inflammation and repair

Ankle swelling 
* is most likely to result from peripheral edema secondary to congestive heart failure

Increased susceptibility to bruising
* prolonged glucocorticoid administration
* also leukopenia

Asthma
* results from bronchoconstriction mediated by leukotrienes 

Fever 
* prostaglandin release

chronic inflammation
* mononuclear cell infiltration
* fibrosis and angiogenesis
* repair

Serous inflammation
* exudation of fluid into the subcorneal or subepidermal space and the fluid is relatively protein-poor.

fibrin accumulation
* protein-rich exudate 

Granulomatous inflammation
* collections of transformed macrophages called epithelioid cells

Purulent inflammation
* Acute inflammatory cells, mainly neutrophils, exuded into a body cavity or space form a purulent (suppurative) exudate, typically associated with liquefactive necrosis

Ulceration
* Loss of the epithelium

Candida
* a commensal organism in the oropharyngeal region and rarely causes pneumonia in healthy **(non-immunosuppressed)** individuals. 

Cytomegalovirus
* produce a mononuclear interstitial inflammatory cell response

Enterobacter aerogenes
* produce acute inflammation.

Plasmodium falciparum
* produces malaria, a parasitic infection without a significant degree of lung involvement.

Staphylococcus aureus
* endocarditis

Streptococcus pyogenes(strep throat)
* acute inflammation
* fever caused by bacterial organisms through release of pyrogen. 

Acute hepatitis
* hepatocyte necrosis
* elevations in AST and ALT


### immune diseases

gout
* urate crystals deposition

Type I Hypersensisty
* with antigen triggering mast cell–bound IgE with release of preformed mediators such as histamine.
* Leukotriene C4 
* Mast cells degranulate with antigen attachment to IgE

Type II Hypersensisty


Type III Hypersensisty
* Arthus reaction 

Type IV Hypersensisty
* Langhans giant cells are seen in granulomatous inflammation

Goodpasture syndrome
* an autoantibody is directed against type IV collagen in basement membranes of the glomeruli and in the lung. This is a form of type II hypersensitivity reaction.

A major transfusion reaction 
* results from a type II hypersensitivity reaction. 
* The patient’s serum contains naturally occurring antibodies to the incompatible donor RBCs.
* C5-9 membrane attack complex

Antigen-antibody complex formation
* is typical of a type III hypersensitivity reaction.

Mast cells degranulate 
* with antigen attachment to IgE in type I hypersensitivity reactions.

Myasthenia gravis
* a form of type II hypersensitivity reaction in which antibody is directed against cell surface receptors. 
* Thymic hyperplasia or thymoma is likely to be present. 
* Antibodies to acetylcholine receptors impair skeletal muscle motor end plates function

dermatomyositis
* Immune complex–mediated injury

polymyositis
* Muscle lysis by CD8+ T cells
* criteria for SLE

Delayed-type hypersensitivity 
* more likely in parasitic infestations of muscles.

parasitic infection
* IgG and IgE antibodies bearing Fc receptors coat the parasite. 
* Antibody-mediated cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) receptor–mediated inflammation and phagocytosis, characteristic for ADCC. 
Macrophages, natural killer cells, neutrophils recognize the Fc receptor, then destroy the antibody-coated target cells.

hemolysis
* Complement-mediated lysis, typical of immune destruction of RBCs

serum sickness 
* in response to the injected foreign protein
* produced widespread antigen-antibody complex deposition, particularly in the kidneys.

Thrombocytopenia
* thrombotic microangiopathy such as thrombotic throm- bocytopenic purpura

Hypocomplementemia
* In the localized immune complex reaction (Arthus reaction), activation and depletion of complement C3.

Graft-versus-host disease 
* characterized by epidermal apoptosis and rash in persons receiving an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant.

rheumatic heart disease
* Streptococcal M proteins cross-react with cardiac glycoproteins, resulting in rheumatic heart disease
* a form of autoimmunity

Breakdown of T cell anergy 
* localized tissue damage and inflammation -> up-regulation of co-stimulatory molecules on the target tissues.
* brain and in pancreatic islet β cells

polyclonal lymphocyte activation
* Microbial products such as endotoxin or bacterial superantigens 

Release of sequestered antigens
* can cause autoimmunity

coagulopathy
* Antiphospholipid antibodies

rheumatic fever
* a microbial antigen cross-reacts with a normal tissue

toxic shock syndrome
* Widespread and non- specific activation of T cells by superantigens 

glomerulonephritis
* proteinuria with hematuria, renal failure.(SLE)

scleroderma
* Raynaud phenomenon
* Esophageal dysmotility

Bronchoconstriction
* bronchial asthma, allergies as type I hypersensitivity reaction

Cerebral lymphomas
* may occur in immunodeficient patients, patients with AIDS.

Keratoconjunctivitis
* Sjögren syndrome -> decreased tear production (lacrimal gland inflammation.)

Sacroiliitis 
* feature of many of the spondyloarthropathies, such as ankylosing spondylitis.

Sclerodactyly 
* in scleroderma

CREST syndrome
* calcinosis, Raynaud phenomenon, esophageal dysmotility, sclerodactyly, and telangiectasia.
* when it involves only a few areas of the skin (e.g., just the hands), it is more likely to indicate limited scleroderma

A drug-induced systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)
* Caused by drugs such as isoniazid, pro- cainamide, and hydralazine
* ANA are often positive
* But anti–double-stranded DNA are negative

Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity
* is initiated when IgG or IgE coats a target to attract cells that affect lysis

discoid lupus erythematosus
* skin lesions similar to those of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), but with systemic involvement much less likely to occur.
* Self nucleic acids mimic their microbial counterparts, and in conjunction with TLRs, they incite type I interferon production to activate dendritic cells and B cells. 
* They also promote a TH1 response, which contributes to autoimmunity. 
* immune complex deposition only in sun-exposed areas of the skin, 
* a positive ANA test result in a few cases, 
* absence of anti-Smith or anti–double-stranded DNA antibodies
* absence of serious renal disease. 

sympathetic ophthalmia
* Release of sequestered antigens 

Non-Hodgkin lymphoma
* maybe triggered by Sjögren syndrome

Libman-Sacks endocarditis 
* SLE

Nongonococcal urethritis
* seen in reactive arthritis, along with conjunctivitis and arthritis.

Diffuse systemic sclerosis 
* initially skin involvement 
* rapidly progresses to visceral organ involvement, including the small arteries of the kidney. 
* These are damaged by a hyperplastic arteriolosclerosis, complicated by very high blood pressure and renal failure. 

Ankylosing spondylitis 
* is one of the spondyloarthropathies
* it is characterized by low back pain from sacroiliitis and positive serology for HLA-B27.

rheumatoid arthritis
* progressive joint deformity
* rheumatoid factor and antibodies to cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP)

Bony ankylosis 
* a feature of progressive or recurrent joint inflammation with rheumatoid arthritis. 

Pericarditis 
* a feature of systemic lupus erythematosus or diffuse systemic sclerosis.

Sjogren syndrome
*Xerophthalmia (usually with accompanying xerostomia) 

fascicular myocyte necrosis
* The perivascular and perimysial inflammatory infiltrates result in peripheral muscle 

 Dermatomyositis 
 * causes muscle pain, and the rash is typically a subtle heliotrope rash with a violaceous appearance to the eyelids;
