hows noncaseating granulomas with many epithelioid cells and two prominent large Langhans gi- ant cells. If special stains and/or cultures for organisms (usu- ally mycobacteria or fungi) are negative, then this is likely sarcoidosis.

[Figure 3](/assets/pathology/test1/3.png)
shows a subacute infarction with granu- lation tissue formation containing numerous capillaries stimulated by vascular endothelial growth factor, repre- senting a healing response.

[Figure 4](/assets/pathology/test1/4.png)
 shows dense collagen with some remaining dilated blood vessels, typical of the final phase of wound healing, which is extensive by the end of the first month.

 *note*
 * On day 1, the wound is filled only with fibrin and inflammatory cells. 
 * Macrophages and granulation tissue are seen 2 to 3 days postoperatively. 
 * Neovascularization is most prominent by days 4 and 5.
 * By week 2, collagen is prominent, and fewer vessels and inflammatory cells are seen.

 The figure shows the so-called wire loop glomeru- lar capillary lesions of lupus nephritis. Anti-Smith and anti– double-stranded DNA are more specific for systemic lupus erythematosus, but sensitivity is low: anti-Smith is present in only 25% of SLE cases.

 immune complex–mediated glomerulonephritis
 The immune complexes activate complement and result in acute inflam- mation
