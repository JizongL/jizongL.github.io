diffuse reticulonodular pulmonary densities


[Figure 2](/assets/pathology/test1/2.png)
hows noncaseating granulomas with many epithelioid cells and two prominent large Langhans gi- ant cells. If special stains and/or cultures for organisms (usu- ally mycobacteria or fungi) are negative, then this is likely sarcoidosis.

[Figure 3](/assets/pathology/test1/3.png)
shows a subacute infarction with granu- lation tissue formation containing numerous capillaries stimulated by vascular endothelial growth factor, repre- senting a healing response.

[Figure 4](/assets/pathology/test1/4.png)
 shows dense collagen with some remaining dilated blood vessels, typical of the final phase of wound healing, which is extensive by the end of the first month.

 *note*
 * On day 1, the wound is filled only with fibrin and inflammatory cells. 
 * Macrophages and granulation tissue are seen 2 to 3 days postoperatively. 
 * Neovascularization is most prominent by days 4 and 5.
 * By week 2, collagen is prominent, and fewer vessels and inflammatory cells are seen.

 The figure shows the so-called wire loop glomeru- lar capillary lesions of lupus nephritis. Anti-Smith and anti– double-stranded DNA are more specific for systemic lupus erythematosus, but sensitivity is low: anti-Smith is present in only 25% of SLE cases.

 immune complex–mediated glomerulonephritis
 The immune complexes activate complement and result in acute inflammation

### Neoplastic diseases

[Figure 7](/assets/pathology/test1/7.png)
The figure shows an in situ carcinoma of the squamous cervical epithelium with neoplastic growth only above the basement membrane.

[Figure 8](/assets/pathology/test1/8.png)
The cells shown in the figure show marked pleomorphism and hyperchromatism (anaplasia), and it is difficult to discern the cell of origin because no differentiation is noted. A bizarre tripolar mitotic figure is present. This de- gree of anaplasia is consistent with an aggressive, high-grade malignancy called anaplastic carcinoma.

[Figure 9](/assets/pathology/test1/9.png)
In the figure the disorderly, atypical epithelial cells involve the entire thickness of the epithelium. They extend through the underlying basement membrane and into the underlying stroma as rounded nests at the right, a process known as invasion. The ectocervix and the squamous metaplasia of endocervix give rise to dysplasia from which squamous cell carcinoma can arise.

The figure shows the appearance of multiple vari- ably sized tan metastatic lesions in the liver from hematogenous spread of carcinoma

[Figure 11](/assets/pathology/test1/9.png)
Infiltrating ductal and intraductal carcinoma are present in the figure. Increased expression of ERBB2 (HER2) can be detected immunohistochemically and by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in the biopsy specimen. One third of breast cancers may show this change. Such amplifi- cation is associated with a poorer prognosis.
