###Question 1

At autopsy, the heart of a 63 year-old man weighs only 250 grams and has small right and left ventricles. The myocardium is firm, with a dark chocolate-brown color throughout. The coronary arteries show minimal atherosclerotic changes. An excessive amount of which of the following substances will be found in the myocardial fibers of this heart?

* **Lipofuscin** 

* Bilirubin 

* Hemosiderin 

* Melanin

{% highlight liquid %}
{% raw %}
Lipofuscin is a “wear-and-tear” pigment that in- creases with aging, particularly in liver and myocardium. This granular golden brown pigment seen adjacent to the myocyte nucleus in the figure has minimal effect on cellu- lar function in most cases. Rarely, there is marked lipofus- cin deposition in a small heart, a so-called brown atrophy. Bilirubin, another breakdown product of hemoglobin, im- parts a yellow appearance (icterus) to tissues. Hemosiderin is the breakdown product of hemoglobin that contains the iron. Hearts with excessive iron deposition tend to be large. Glycogen is increased in some inherited enzyme disorders, and when the heart is involved, heart size increases. Melanin pigment is responsible for skin tone: the more melanin, the darker the skin.

###Question 2

A 40 year-old woman has had chronic congestive heart failure for the past three years. In the past two months, she developed a cough productive of rust-colored sputum. A sputum cytology specimen shows numerous hemosiderin-laden macrophages. Which of the following subcellular structures in macrophages is most important for the accumulation of this pigment?

* Chromosome 

* Ribosome 

* Endoplasmic reticulum 

* **Lysosome** 

* Golgi apparatus 

{% highlight liquid %}
{% raw %}
Heterophagocytosis by macrophages requires that endocytosed vacuoles fuse with lysosomes to degrade the engulfed material. With congestive heart failure, extravasation

###Question 3

A 38 year-old man has had headaches and nausea for the past 2 months. Laboratory findings show hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia and normal serum albumin. Urine microscopic analysis shows deposition of calcium salts in the renal tubular epithelium. Which of the following processes has most likely produced this change in the kidney?

* Cellular aging 

* Dystrophic calcification 

* Autophagocytosis 

* **Metastatic calcification** 

* Renal tubular atrophy 

{% highlight liquid %}
{% raw %}
Metastatic calcification can occur widely throughout the body but principally affects the interstitial tissues of the vas- culature, kidneys, lungs, and gastric mucosa. The calcium deposits morphologically resemble those described in dys- trophic calcification

###Question 5

An experiment introduces bacteria into a perfused tissue preparation. Leukocytes then leave the vasculature and migrate to the site of bacterial inoculation. The movement of these leukocytes is most likely to be mediated by which of the following substances?

* Prostaglandins 

* Bradykinin 

* **Chemokines** 

* Histamine 

* Complement C3a 

{% highlight liquid %}
{% raw %}
Chemokines include many molecules that are chemotactic for neutrophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, and basophils. Bradykinin causes pain and increased vascu- lar permeability. Complement C3a causes increased vascular permeability by releasing histamine from mast cells. Hista- mine causes vascular leakage. Prostaglandins have multiple actions, but they do not cause chemotaxis.

###Question 6

An 18 year-old man lacerated his left hand and required sutures. The sutures were removed one week later. Wound healing continued, but the site became disfigured by a prominent raised, nodular scar that developed over the next two months. Which of the following terms best describes the process that occurred during this 2-month period?

* **Keloid formation** 

* Dehiscence 

* Secondary union 

* Organization 

* Resolution 

{% highlight liquid %}
{% raw %}
The healing process sometimes results in an exuber- ant production of collagen, giving rise to a keloid, which is a prominent raised, nodular scar, as shown in the figure. This tendency may run in families. Dehiscence occurs when a wound pulls apart. Organization occurs as granulation tissue is replaced by fibrous tissue. If normal tissue architecture is restored, resolution of inflammation has occurred. Second- ary union describes the process by which large wounds fill in and contract.

###Question 7

A 59 year-old man has had a cough and fever for the past week. On physical exam, his temperature is 38.5 degrees Celsius. On auscultation, he has decreased breath sounds and dullness to percussion over the right lung. A chest radiograph shows fluid in the right pleural cavity. Thoracentesis yields 500 mL of cloudy yellow fluid. Which of the following cell types is most likely to be abundant in this fluid?

* Eosinophils 

* CD4 lymphocytes 

* Macrophages 

* Plasma cells 

* **Neutrophils** 

{% highlight liquid %}
{% raw %}
Bacterial infections often evoke an acute inflammatory response dominated by neutrophils. The extravasated neutro- phils attempt to phagocytose and kill the bacteria. In the pro- cess, some neutrophils die, and the release of their lysosomal enzymes can cause liquefactive necrosis of the tissue. This liquefied tissue debris and both live and dead neutrophils comprise pus, or purulent exudate. Such an exudate is typi- cal of bacterial infections that involve body cavities. Another term for purulent exudate in the pleural space is empyema.

###Question 8

A 5 year-old child has a history of recurrent bacterial infections, inluding pneumonia and otitis media. Analysis of leukocytes collected from the peripheral blood shows a deficiency of myeloperoxidase. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this child's increased susceptibility to infections?

* Defective neutrophil degranulation 

* Defective production of prostaglandins 

* Decreased oxygen consumption after phagocytosis 

* **Failure to produce hydroxy-halide radicals (HOCL-)** 

* Failure to produce hydrogen peroxide 

{% highlight liquid %}
{% raw %}
Myeloperoxidase is present in the azurophilic gran- ules of neutrophils. It converts H2O2 into HOCl–, a power- ful oxidant and antimicrobial agent. Degranulation occurs as phagolysosomes are formed with engulfed bacteria in phagocytic vacuoles within the neutrophil cytoplasm. Oxy- gen consumption with an oxidative or respiratory burst after phagocytosis is aided by glucose oxidation and activation of neutrophil NADPH oxidase, resulting in generation of superoxide that is converted by spontaneous dismutation to H2O2. In contrast, prostaglandin production depends on a functioning cyclooxygenase pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism.

###Question 9

A 35 year-old woman takes acetysalicylic acid (aspirin) for arthritis. Although her joint pain is reduced with this therapy, the inflammation process continues. The aspirin therapy alleviates her pain mainly through reduction in the synthesis of which of the following mediators?

* Leukotriene E4 

* Complement C1q 

* **Prostaglandins** 

* Nitric Oxide 

* Histamine 

{% highlight liquid %}
{% raw %}
Prostaglandins are produced through the cyclooxy- genase pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism. Aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs block the synthesis of prostaglandins, which can produce pain. Com- plement C1q is generated in the initial stage of complement activation, which can eventually result in cell lysis. Hista- mine is mainly a vasodilator. Leukotrienes are generated by the lipoxygenase pathway, which is not blocked by aspirin. Nitric oxide released from endothelium is a vasodilator.

###Question 10

On a routine visit to the physician, an otherwise healthy 51 year-old man has a blood pressure of 150/95 mmHg. If the patient's hypertension remains untreated for years, which of the following cellular alterations will most likely be seen in the myocardium?

* Hyperplasia 

* Hypertrophy 

* Metaplasia 

* Hemosiderosis 

* Atrophy 

{% highlight liquid %}
{% raw %}
The pressure load on the left ventricle results in an increase in myofilaments in the existing myofibers, so they enlarge. The result of continued stress from hypertension is eventual heart failure with decreased contractility. Apoptosis would lead to loss of cells and diminished size. Dysplasia is not a diagnosis made for the heart. Hemosiderin deposition in the heart is a pathologic process resulting from increased iron stores in the body. Though hyperplasia from prolifera- tion of myofibroblasts is possible, this does not contribute significantly to cardiac size. Metaplasia of muscle does not occur, although loss of muscle occurs with aging and ischemia as myofibers are replaced by fibrous tissue.
