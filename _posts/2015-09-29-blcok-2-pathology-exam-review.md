Infectious Mononucleosis

Reed-Sternberg cells, the hallmark of Hodgkin lymphoma, often are seen.

acute nonspecific lymphadenitis

Sinus Histiocytosis. This reactive pattern is characterized by distention and prominence of the lymphatic sinusoids, owing to a marked hypertrophy of lining endothelial cells and an infiltrate of macrophages (histiocytes). It often is encountered in lymph nodes draining cancers and may represent an immune response to the tumor or its products.


## Laboratory Findings 

ALL 

* The white cell count is variable; it may be greater than 100,000 cells/μL but in about half of the patients is less than 10,000 cells/μL. Anemia is almost always present, and the platelet count usually is below 100,000/μL. Neutropenia is another common finding.

## Genetic Features. 

ALL

* non-random karyotypic abnormalities. 

* common in child- hood pre-B cell tumors are hyperdiploidy 

* a cryptic (12;21) translocation involving the TEL1 and AML1 genes

* 25% of adult pre-B cell tumors harbor the (9;22) translocation involving the ABL and BCR genes

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and small lympho- cytic lymphoma (SLL)

* exceeds 4000 cells/μL, the patient is diagnosed with CLL; if it does not, a diagnosis of SLL is made.

* CLL/SLL is much less common in Asia.

* CLL is more common than SLL in the west. 

* immune dysregulation. 

* accumulation of CLL/SLL cells suppresses normal B cell function(unclear mechanism), -> hypogammaglobulinemia

* proliferation centers

* chromosomal translocations are rare.

* Approximately 50% of tumors have karyotypic abnormalities, the most common of which are trisomy 12 and deletions of chromosomes 11, 13, and 17.

Follicular l􏰎ym􏰁phom􏰁a

* Express BCL2

* (14;18) translocation, fuses the BCL2 on chromosome 18 to IgH locus on chromosome 14. 

* nodular proliferation

* predominant neoplastic cells are slightly larger than resting lymphocytes that have angular “cleaved” nuclei with prominent indentations and linear infoldings (Fig. 11–16, B). The nuclear chromatin is coarse and condensed, and nucleoli are indistinct. These small, cleaved cells are mixed with variable numbers of larger cells with vesicular chromatin, several nucleoli, and modest amounts of cytoplasm. In most tumors, large cells are a minor component of the **overall cellularity**, mitoses are infrequent, and single necrotic cells (cells undergoing apoptosis) are not seen. These features help to distinguish follicular lymphoma from **follicular hyperplasia**, in which mitoses and apoptosis are prominent.

Mantle Cell l􏰎ym􏰁phom􏰁a

* Mantle cell lymphoma is composed of cells resembling the naive B cells found in the mantle zones of normal lymphoid follicles.

* lymphomatoid polyposis. (11;14) translocation

* that fuses the cyclin D1 gene to the IgH locus.

* distinguished from CLL/SLL by the absence of proliferation centers and the presence of cyclin D1 protein.

## immunotyping

ALL

* Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), an enzyme specifically expressed in pre-B and pre-T cells, is present in more than 95% of cases. Further subtyping of ALL into pre-B and pre-T cell types relies on stains for lineage-specific markers, such as CD19 (B cell) and CD3 (T cell).

CLL/SLL 

* a neoplasm of mature B cells expressing the pan-B cell markers CD19, CD20, and CD23 and surface immunoglobulin heavy and light chains. 

* tumor cells also express CD5

Folicular Lymphoma

* These tumors express pan-B cell markers (CD19 and CD20), CD10, and BCL6, a transcription factor required for the generation of germinal center B cells.

* Follicular lymphoma mainly occurs in adults older than 50 years of age and affects males and females equally.

Mantle cell lymphoma

* The tumor cells usually coexpress surface IgM and IgD, pan-B cell antigens (CD19 and CD20), and CD5.



## Prognosis

ALL

* 2 to 10 years of age have the best prognosis
 
* worse outcomes includes male gender; age younger than 2 or older than 10 years; a high leukocyte count at diagnosis; and molecular evidence of persistent disease on day 28 of treatment.

* good prognosis - chromosomal aberrations (such as the t[12;21] and hyperdiploidy) are common in the 2- to 10-year age group

* bad prognosis - rearrangements of the gene MLL or the presence of a BCR-ABL fusion gene, both associated with poor outcomes in B cell tumors, are most common in children younger than 2 years of age and adult

CLL/SLL

* lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly are present in 50% to 60% of patients.

* half has Hypogammaglobulinemia (susceptibility to bacterial infections)

* autoimmune hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia (less common)

Follicular lymphoma

* painless, generalized lymphadenopathy.

* not curable

* therapy with cytotoxic drugs and rituximab (anti-CD20 antibody) is reserved for those with bulky, symptomatic disease.

B, Acute myeloid leukemia. Myeloblasts have delicate nuclear chromatin, prominent nucleoli, and fine azurophilic cytoplasmic granules. 433

B, At high power, a majority of the tumor cells have the appearance of small, round lymphocytes. A “prolymphocyte,” a larger cell with a centrally placed nucleolus, also is present in this field (arrow).    2
