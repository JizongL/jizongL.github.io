<!--break-->
### 2. What are some causes of bone marrow failure? 

### CBC Results:

|patient |					Reference Interval

### 3. Describe the findings in the complete blood count.  Is the patient anemic, and if so, how would you describe the anemia?  Is the patient neutropenic?  Explain how the absolute neutrophil count is calculated.  What is the significance of neutropenia?

### 4. Examine the peripheral smear and describe the cells.  What are these cells and what do they indicate?

### 5. What are common leukemias that afflict children?

### 6. What information do you glean from these cytochemical stains?

* Sudan black B and myeloperoxidase - negative in blasts, positive in normal neutrophils 

* PAS - block positivity in blasts (see figure below)

* Specific and non-specific esterases - negative in blasts

### more description for patient

The lab calls you with the CBC results as the patient is being taken to Radiology.  At this point, you decide a bone marrow biopsy is more important than the X-ray and call the patient back for a marrow biopsy, sending an aspirate to the Immunopathology Lab for flow cytometry immunophenotyping of the blasts.


### 7. Explain the flow cytometry results.  How do immunophenotyping studies (flow cytometry) help determine the diagnosis?  Refer to the chart of lymphocyte maturation (next slide) for a reference.

|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| CD45	| positive |	Surface kappa|	negative |
| CD34	|	negative |	Surface lambda |	negative |
| HLA-DR	| positive |	CD2		|	negative |
| TdT		| positive |	CD3		|	negative |
| CD20		| positive | 	CD5		|	negative |
| CD19		| positive | 	CD10			| positive |

### 9.  What is the prognosis for this patient based on WBC, age, and gender?  Describe favorable and unfavorable cytogenetic findings for patients with ALL.


### 10. The patient is treated with chemotherapy including vincristine, prednisone, and L-asparaginase with intrathecal methotrexate (MTX).  Why is intrathecal treatment indicated?

* a. What is the mechanism of the chemotherapeutic agents in general?  
* b. With what enzyme does methotrexate (MTX) interfere?
* c. What is complete remission (CR)?




## Case 2

### Case History

The patient is a 77 year-old man with **extreme fatigue and malaise**.  He saw a doctor at a walk-in clinic seven months ago for similar complaints.  He shows you the prescription given to him then, which he has faithfully taken.  It is a **multivitamin with iron**.  He is on no other medications.  He is thin, but not cachectic and he appears tired. 

No abnormalities are found on physical exam except for **petechiae**, a few **bruises** on his lower legs, **pallor and pale mucous membranes**.  The digital rectal exam shows no enlargement of the prostate gland and the stool guaiac test is negative | for occult blood.  You send a blood sample in a purple top (EDTA) tube for a CBC with reticulocyte count. 


### CBC Results:

|patient| Reference Interval|
|:---:| :---:|
| WBC=1,180/mm3|(4000-11,000/mm3) |
| HGB=10 g/dL|(14-18 g/dL)|
|HCT=30%|(42-49%)|
|MCV=103 fL	|(80-99 fL)|
| MCHC=33 g/dL|(31-37 g/dL)|
| RDW=20|(11.5-14.5) |
|PLATELETS=50,000/mm3|(130,-400,000/mm3)|
|RETICULOCYTE (%)=0.1 %| (0.5-1.5%, manual)|


#### WBC Differential (%)

65 segs, 30 lymphocytes, 5 monocytes

### QUESTIONS

### 11. What does the CBC reveal? 

* low htc (anemia), low WBC(pan-cytopenias),low platelets indicates haematopoiesis 


* high MCV >100fL (macrocytosis), the multivitamin given previously was for B12 deficiency. 

* Abnormal RBC maturation (eg, myelodysplastic syndrome, acute leukemia, LGL leukemia)




### 12. Examine the peripheral smear.  Describe your findings, particularly the nuclear features of the neutrophils.  What is this phenomenon called and when may it be seen? 

neutrophils appear bilobed, indicative of Pelger-Huet anomaly. It may be seen in Myelodysplastic Syndromes

![Peripheral blood film](/assets/pathology/smallGroup/WBC/6.jpeg)

### 13. What is your differential diagnosis?

old age, fatigue, anemia , pallor and pale mucous membranes, 

bruise and petechiae assoicated with low platelets count (thrombocytopenia.)

Pelger-Huet anomaly

low htc, low WBC(pan-cytopenias),low platelets indicates haematopoiesis 

**note** patient previous was given iron treatment, and he did not response to it. 


### 14. What is the next diagnostic test which should be performed and why?

[Bone marrow tests](http://www.cancer.org/cancer/myelodysplasticsyndrome/detailedguide/myelodysplastic-syndromes-diagnosis)

These tests are used first for diagnosis and classification and may be repeated later to tell if the MDS is responding to therapy or is transforming into an acute leukemia.



### 15. Examine the bone marrow aspirate and biopsy (slides 2-5).  Describe your findings.  What are typical marrow findings in myelodysplastic syndromes? 

1 Bone marrow biopsy showed 100% cellularity with erythroid predominance and granulocytic and megakaryocytic dyspoiesis


2 dysplastic red cell precursors manifested by abnormal nuclear contours, nuclear budding, and other abnormalities of nuclei


3 Significant erythroid predominance with dyserythropoiesis and with Auer rod. (confirmed it is AML)  

4 Hypercellular bone marrow with dysmegakaryopoiesis.

### 16. Describe low and high-grade myelodysplastic syndromes in terms of marrow cellularity.

progress slowly and may cause mild to moderate anemia (a low number of red cells), or decrements to other types of cells.

* higher blast counts and more severe cytopenias, as well as the presence of multiple clonal chromosomal abnormalities.

**additional information** (see [source here](http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/kimmel_cancer_center/types_cancer/myelodysplastic_syndrome.html))

*immature cells called blast cells make up more than 5 percent of the cells in the marrow.*

*When MDS patients develop more than 20 percent blast cells, they are reclassified as having acute myelogenous leukemia (AML)*


### 17. What is aleukemic leukemia?  

blasts are entirely absent from the blood (aleukemic leukemia).

### 18. What findings might you expect on a karyotyping study of the marrow in MDS?  What is the most common cytogenetic abnormality in acute myeloid leukemia?


* Monosomies 5 and 7
* Deletions of 5q, 7q, and 20q
* Trisomy 8
