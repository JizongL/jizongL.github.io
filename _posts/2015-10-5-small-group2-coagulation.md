## Coagulation Case 1

### background info

An 89 year-old man is admitted to the hospital from a local nursing home with generalized weakness, nausea, vomiting, fever, mild hypertension, and right lower lobe crepitant rales. Additional findings include a pale, cachexic, edentulous, and extremely agitated elderly man who is mildly disoriented to time and place. Examination of the skin reveals numerous small bruises and ecchymoses on arms, forearms, thighs, and the dorsal aspect of both hands. The bruises are of different sizes and various ages. The larger bruises are the more recent bruises and are painful. Blood is noted to extravasate at the phlebotomy sites and bright red blood is noted peri-rectally. The chest x-ray reveals right, lower lobe pneumonia, and the EKG is normal.

Family History: There is no family history of bleeding problems or bleeding disorders.

### 1. For each of the following patient signs, give a brief description of possible etiologies:

* Bruising

* Ecchymoses

* Extravasation 

* Rectal Bleeding

### 2. What coagulation laboratory tests would you order and why?

### 3. What is your interpretation of the complete blood count? (next slide)

###￼5. Based on these initial findings, mixing studies and certain factor levels (next question) are performed. What is a mixing study and how is it performed? What information does a mixing study provide? Interpret the following mixing study information:

Mixing Study with PT:

| :---: | :---: |
|Dilutions |   Results |
|1:1, 4:1  |  11, 12 seconds |
￼￼
### 6.  Interpret these factor levels. What factors are vitamin K dependent? (hint). What is the diagnosis?

| :---: | :---: | :---: |
|Factor |VII 20% |(50-150%) |
|Factor| V 110% | (50-150%)|

### 7. How would you correct this coagulation problem?

￼
## Coagulation Case 2

### background information 

A pale but pleasant twelve year-old seventh grader began menses 14 months ago, and has had severe menorrhagia. She has had frequent nosebleeds since the age of four. An endocrine work-up is negative for anovulatory cycles. A careful history reveals her older sister, mother, and maternal aunt had similar menorrhagia. Her older brother and maternal uncle bruise easily and have frequent nosebleeds. All the members of her family are blood type 0 positive.

### 8. What is your interpretation of the complete blood count (next slide)?

### CBC count 

| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| WBC: 	|	5400/mm3	|	(3.0-10.0X103)		|
| Hgb: 	|	10.1 mg/dl	|	(12.0-14.0)		|

|Lymphocytes |	35%|	(25-46)	|


### 9. What coagulation tests would you order and why? Look at the test results. What is your interpretation of these coagulation tests? What do the PFA-100 results indicate?

### 10. Based on the clinical presentation, family history, and preliminary laboratory results, generate a differential diagnosis. What is the apparent mode of inheritance?

### 11. A mixing study is performed. What information do you glean from the results. Do you have a working diagnosis? How do you explain the factor VIII level?

Mixing study with PTT:

| :---: | :---: |
|Dilution	| Results|
|1:1, 1:4	| 29, 32 sec|

| :---: | :---: |
|Factor VIII |	35%    | [50-150%]|

￼￼
### 12. Explain the following test results. Is the defect primarily of vWF quantity or quality? State the diagnosis.

| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| von Willebrand cofactor assay	|20%	|		[40-140%]|
| von Willebrand assay		|	15%		|	[45-180%]|
| Multimer assay			|		Normal pattern|

**Hints:**

von Willebrand cofactor assay=functional test 
von Willebrand assay=quantitative test


### 13. Von Willebrand disease manifests in several different types. Discuss the three main types and decide what type of von Willebrand disease this patient has.
￼
### 14. Describe acquired von Willebrand disease. What are the disease associations and proposed mechanisms?

### 15. How would you manage this patient’s current excessive bleeding? What choices are available if surgery is required in the future?

### 16. As this young girl reaches the age of 60 her bruising may decrease. Why?

### 17. Why is the blood type important in assessing a patient for von Willebrand disease?

### 18.  Briefly describe the subtypes of type 2 von Willebrand disease.

### 19.  What is “platelet type” or “pseudo –vWD”?
