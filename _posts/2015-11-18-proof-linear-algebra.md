Prove that a vector space has only one zero vector. (Exercise 4.2, 19.) 
<!--break-->
Solution: Suppose that z1 and z2 are two zero vectors of the vector space.
Since z1 is a zero vector, and z2 another vector, by the third property (page 189) in the definition of a vector space. 
z2 ⊕z1 =z1 ⊕z2 =z2

Comment: That is, just plug in z1 where you see 0, and z2 where you see u. Similarly, since
z2 is a zero vector, and z1 is another vector, we have:
z1 ⊕z2 =z2 ⊕z1 =z1

By the two equations above, we have
z1 ⊕ z2 = z1 = z2
Thus z1 = z2. That is, any two zero vectors must be equal, so that the zero vector is unique.

3. Prove that a vector u in a vector space has only one negative, -u. (Exercise 4.2, 20.) 

Solution: Suppose that v and w are two additive inverses of u. Since w is an additive inverse

Add v to both sides.

v⊕u⊕w = v⊕0 v⊕u⊕w = v
􏰂 􏰁􏰀 􏰃
0
u⊕w=0
(property 3 in vector space defn)
(property 4, since v is an additive inverse) (property 3)
￼￼0⊕w = v w= v
Thus, w = v, so that the additive inverse of u is unique.


## Orthogonal complements

N(A) is the orthogonal complement 

Solution: Suppose that z1 and z2 are two zero vectors of the vector space.
Since z1 is a zero vector, and z2 another vector, by the third property (page 189) in the definition of a vector space. 
z2 ⊕z1 =z1 ⊕z2 =z2

Comment: That is, just plug in z1 where you see 0, and z2 where you see u. Similarly, since
z2 is a zero vector, and z1 is another vector, we have:
z1 ⊕z2 =z2 ⊕z1 =z1

By the two equations above, we have
z1 ⊕ z2 = z1 = z2
Thus z1 = z2. That is, any two zero vectors must be equal, so that the zero vector is unique.

3. Prove that a vector u in a vector space has only one negative, -u. (Exercise 4.2, 20.) 

Solution: Suppose that v and w are two additive inverses of u. Since w is an additive inverse

Add v to both sides.

v⊕u⊕w = v⊕0 v⊕u⊕w = v
􏰂 􏰁􏰀 􏰃

u⊕w=0
(property 3 in vector space defn)
(property 4, since v is an additive inverse) (property 3)
￼￼0⊕w = v w= v
Thus, w = v, so that the additive inverse of u is unique.
