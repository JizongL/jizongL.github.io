## Introduction
[Twine](http://twinery.org) is an open-source tool for telling interactive, nonlinear stories. It was developed by [Chris Klimas](http://chrisklimas.com) back in 2009. 

And the good news is that you don't need any expert experience with software or web development in order to Twine!

So, what exactly can Twine help you? I think its power has no boundary. 

Let's go through an example to illusrate what Twine can do.

##Building your first project
Ok, let's start building a very simple project to illustrate the workflow of Twine. 

Before I walk you through the nitty gritty, let's make sure that 
*you have Twine downloaded. [Download Twine here](http://twinery.org) 
*And you have a [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com) account setup. 
*You can also download the Twine template file [My first trial here](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/49272502/video%20project/my%20first%20trial.html) 



### The two basic syntaxes to remember

To build this project, you only need to remember two syntaxes below. 

<code>
[[]]  
 ##
</code>


You can see the demo video for building a simple project from [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4Hzt9LtR7g&t=2m35s)

## Adding a Home button 

See video demo [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5V0glS88MGs&feature=youtu.be)

## Adding images

After mastering some basic text editing skill with TWINE, it is time to consider adding some images to your webpage. To do that, all you need to remember is the following [html image tag](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_img.asp)


{% highlight liquid %}
{% raw %}
 <img src="image url"> 
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}


[Click here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4Hzt9LtR7g&t=5m23s) to the video demo for adding image. 


## publish your work
Now, the last step is to publish your result. 
The finished product is a html file, you can copy and paste it on your [dropbox public](https://www.dropbox.com/en/help/20) folder, and then generate a public link and share it with your friends.

###tips
I made up a list of tips to share with you to end this tutorial. 


* Use a unique title for every single passage box. 
* Use the same naming convention for all boxes
* When you use online images, make sure they are not copyright protected. 
* find images that are in similar resolution. 
* push the play button to test the result every now and then, it is always good to debug early.
