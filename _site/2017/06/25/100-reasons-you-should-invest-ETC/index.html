<p>100 Reasons why you should invest into Ethereum Classic right now.</p>

<p>Just about a week ago, I asked my friends on WeChat ETC-讨论群 group to give me 100 reasons why ETC will go up to $100. I received various mixed answers, both professional and irrational. 
Some of them are even amusing or bizzare. 
To see the full list of reasons I collected, <a href="">click here</a></p>

<p>Compared to 10 to 11 months ago, ETC has grown into a different animal. The day when ETC is less than 1 dollar is gone, instead it is now nearly 20x increased in dollar value. The question we are going to ask is, will ETC’s growth last? Should we invest into it now?</p>

<p>About 10 or 11 months ago and since then, there are quite a lot of people have shared a rather gloomy perspective about ETC. I would like to share my own opinions about</p>

<p>@crossroads in his article <a href="https://steemit.com/ethereum/@crossroads/eth-vs-etc-what-matters-is-the-future">ETH vs. ETC - What matters is the future</a> says the following</p>

<p>“<em>ETC goes currently for a high price for several reasons. ETC is still a pretty decent crypto asset compared to its current alternatives. ETC is a neat trading opportunity and thus greatly pumped by traders. ETC is being held as a hedge for the phantasy that it could overtake ETH. However with the facts at hand, that is probably not going to happen. More likely ETC will cripple and be abandoned like dead skin. Other crypto assets will evolve and overtake ETC, traders will dump it, and finally: the phantasy bursts.</em>”</p>

<p>I like the word “Phantasy” @crossroads used, because its definition is “is a state of mind of an infant child during the early stages of development.”.</p>

<p>In my opinion, the “Phantastic ETC community” is now growing up and going to be awesome.</p>

“<em>Dapps. While we know Ethereum use cases and dapps in development it is not the same about Ethereum Classic. However, development of EMERALD SDK (An official desktop wallet, and a flexible SDK to build custom applications on top of Ethereum Classic blockchain) signals that ETC dev team is in favourable direction to attract first developers to build on ETC blockchain. When it happens the price of ETC will shoot up considerably.</em>”</p>

<p>“<em>I still don’t understand the value of ETC and nobody from the ETC supports has been able to explain it to me, and believe me I have tried to listen. I don’t see any advantage ETC has over ETH.</em>”</p>

“<em>So again explain to me the value of ETC. I am truly here to learn and have a dialog with YOU about this subject. I respect the holders of ETC for putting their money where their mouth as did I when I dumped ETC. I am in awe as to what we are experiencing and can learn about blockchains as this story unfolds.</em>”</p>

“*Next step was even more interesting -  miners found out that while difference in price between ETH and ETC is 20 times, difference in mining difficulty is 100 times. That meant that mining ETC was 5 times more profitable then ETH. Guess what? Miners switched to ETC. Right now it stabilized, the difficulty in mining is more or less relevant to the price difference.  *”</p>
