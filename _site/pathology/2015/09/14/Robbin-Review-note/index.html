<h3 id="acute-and-chronic-inflammation">Acute and Chronic Inflammation</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Lymphocytes are a feature of chronic inflammation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nonhuman microbial substances such as double-stranded RNA of viruses, bacterial DNA, and bacterial endotoxin, can be recognized by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) on human cells as part of an innate defense mechanism against infection.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<!--break-->

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Lectins found on cell surfaces can bind a variety of substances, such as fungal polysaccharides, that trigger cellular defenses.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>T cell receptors respond to peptide antigens to trigger a cell-mediated immune response.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Complement C3a causes increased vascular permeability by releasing histamine from mast cells.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This immunoglobulin deficiency prevents opsonization and phagocytosis of microbes. Deficiency of integrins and selectins, or a defect in microtubules, would prevent adhesion and locomotion of neutrophils.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Myeloperoxidase is present in the azurophilic granules of neutrophils. It converts H2O2 into HOCl–</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>NADPH oxidase, resulting in generation of superoxide that is converted by spontaneous dismutation to H2O2.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This burst can be quantitated by flow cytometric analysis.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bacteria are opsonized by complement C3b and IgG, allowing the bacteria to be more readily phagocytosed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Integrins have two chains, α and β. A genetic lack of β chains prevents firm adhesion of leukocytes to endothelial cells.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>c5a that bind to the neutrophil and activate phospholipase C to begin a series of events that culminate in the influx of calcium, which triggers contractile proteins.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>he respiratory burst to kill phagocytized organisms depends on NADPH oxidase, and a deficiency of this enzyme leads to chronic <strong>granulomatous disease.</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Monocytes transforming to macrophages contain cytokine-inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), which generates nitric oxide. Nitric oxide, by itself and on interaction with other reactive oxygen species, has antimicrobial activity.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>CD4 or CD8 lymphocytes can be the source for interferon-γ (IFN-γ), which stimulates macrophage production of NOS.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Interferon-γ also is important in transforming macrophages into epithelioid cells in a granulomatous inflammatory response</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Leukotriene B4, generated in the lipoxygenase pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism, is a potent neutrophil chemotactic factor.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Binding of agonists such as epinephrine, collagen, or thrombin to platelet surface receptors activates phospholipase C, which catalyzes the release of arachidonic acid from two of the major membrane phospholipids, phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylcholine.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bradykinin, generated from the kinin system on surface contact of Hageman factor with collagen and basement membrane from vascular injury, promotes vascular permeability, smooth muscle contraction, and pain</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>C3b may promote phagocytosis</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>C1q is generated in the initial stage of complement activation, which can eventually result in cell lysis.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Leukotrienes are generated by the lipoxygenase pathway, which is not blocked by <strong>aspirin.</strong></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="important-pathways">3 important pathways</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Activation of complement may occur via microbial cell wall components such as polysaccharides (alternative pathway) or</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>mannose (lectin pathway),</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>or antibody attached to surface antigens (classic pathway)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Plasmin is generated from plasminogen and helps lyse clots.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ongoing activation of coagulation generates an inflammatory response that further amplifies coagulation, creating a vicious cycle.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Protein C antagonizes coagulation factor V, which catalyzes activation of prothrombin to thrombin, thereby breaking the cycle of thrombin generation</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Complement components can become activated by <strong>plasmin</strong> (C3) and <strong>kallikrein</strong> (C5), forming <strong>anaphylatoxins</strong> (C3a and C5a) that promote inflammation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A protein-rich exudate results in fibrin accumulation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Granulomatous inflammation is characterized by collections of transformed macrophages called epithelioid cells.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Acute inflammatory cells, mainly neutrophils, exuded into a body cavity or space form a purulent (suppurative) exudate, typically associated with <strong>liquefactive necrosis.</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An abscess is a localized collection of neutrophils <strong>within tissues.</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In fibrinous inflammation, exudation of blood proteins (including fibrinogen, which polymerizes to fibrin) gives a grossly shaggy appearance to surfaces overlying the inflammation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Chronic inflammation occurs when there is a preponderance of mononuclear cells, such as lymphocytes, macrophages, and plasma cells</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Most bacterial pneumonias resolve, and progression to continued chronic inflammation is uncommon.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In acute inflammation, the healing process of fibrosis and angiogenesis has not begun.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Activated macrophages can secrete various cytokines that promote angiogenesis and fibrosis, including platelet-derived growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, interleukin-1 (IL-1), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Plasmodium produces malaria, a parasitic infection without a significant degree of lung involvement.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The pyrogens stimulate prostaglandin synthesis in the hypothalamus to “reset the thermostat,” so that fever occurs as a sign of the acute inflammatory response</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hageman factor initiates the coagulation cascade.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Interleukin-12 (IL-12) released by macrophages <strong>stimulates T-cell responses</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>nitric oxide produced in macrophages aids in microbial killing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>IL-1 and TNF can have autocrine, paracrine, and endocrine effects.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen, and serum amyloid A (SAA) protein. These proteins, particularly fibrinogen, and immunoglobulins increase RBC rouleaux formation to increase the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), which is a nonspecific indicator of inflammation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>CRP production is upregulated by interleukin-6 (IL-6), whereas fibrinogen and SAA are upregulated mainly by tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-1 (IL-1).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hepatocytes are quiescent (stable) cells that can reenter the cell cycle and proliferate in response to hepatic injury, enabling the liver to regenerate partially.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Acute hepatitis results in hepatocyte necrosis, marked by elevations in AST and ALT.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Vitamin C deficiency leads to scurvy, with reduced lysyl oxidase enzyme activity that helps cross-link fibrillar collagens to provide tensile strength.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>final phase of wound healing, which is extensive by the end of the first month.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The inhibition of metalloproteinases leads to decreased degradation of collagen and impaired connective tissue remodeling in wound repair.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) can be produced by endothelium, macrophages, smooth muscle cells, and platelets</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>PDGF mediates migration and proliferation of fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells and <strong>migration of monocytes.</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Glucocorticoids inhibit wound healing by impairing collagen synthesis.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Serine proteinases are important in wound remodeling.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Organization occurs as granulation tissue is replaced by fibrous tissue</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If normal tissue architecture is restored, resolution of inflammation has occurred.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Secondary union describes the process by which large wounds fill in and contract.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The elevated creatine kinase level indicates that myocardial necrosis has occurred(The elevation in the CK level is indicative of myocardial cell necrosis, because this intracellular enzyme does not leak in large quantities from intact myocardial cells.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Coagulative necrosis is typical of myocardial infarction, but after 1 month, a scar would be present.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="cellular-injury">cellular injury</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Nodular regeneration is typical of hepatocyte injury because hepatocytes are stable cells.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accumulation of fat within cells is a common manifestation of sublethal cell injury or, uncommonly, of inborn errors in fat metabolism</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nodular prostatic hyperplasia (also known as benign prostatic hyperplasia [BPH]) is a common condition in older men that results from proliferation of both prostatic glands and stroma.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Aplasia refers to lack of embryonic development;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hyaline change (hyalinosis) refers to a nonspecific, pink, glassy eosinophilic appearance of cells.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Steatosis (fatty change) can lead to hepatomegaly, but not as a regenerative process.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Irreversible cell injury is associated with loss of membrane integrity. This allows intracellular enzymes such as AST and ALT to leak into the serum.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Blunt trauma produces hemorrhage</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Gangrenous necrosis is mainly coagulative necrosis, but occurs over an extensive area of tissues.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Intestinal infarction is a form of coagulative necrosis.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Coagulative necrosis is the typical result of ischemia in most solid organs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fatty change is most often a feature of hepatocyte injury, and the cell integrity is maintained</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reduction in oxidative phosphorylation leads to reduction in synthesis of ATP and diminished activity of the plasma membrane sodium pump, which maintains high intracellular potassium concentration. Loss of ATP leads to efflux of intracellular potassium, while net influx of sodium and water promote cell swelling. A marked rise in plasma potassium can indicate significant cell damage or death (such as skeletal muscle crush injury or hemolysis).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Decreased tissue perfusion from hypotensive shock leads to hypoxemia and depletion of ATP when cell metabolism shifts from aerobic to anaerobic glycolysis. This shift causes depletion of glycogen stores and increased production and accumulation of <strong>lactic acid</strong>, reducing intracellular pH</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Creatinine would increase with reduced renal function from decreased renal perfusion, but this would not explain the changes in other tissues.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An increase in troponin I suggests irreversible myocardial injury.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Irreversible cellular injury is likely to occur when cytoplasmic calcium increases</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The excess calcium activates ATPases, phospholipases, proteases, and endonucleases, which injure cell components.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mitochondrial permeability is increased to release cytochrome c, which activates caspases leading to apoptosis.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The drug acetaminophen can be converted to toxic metabolites in this manner. Glutathione in the cytosol helps to reduce cellular injury from many toxic metabolites and free radicals</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Glutathione peroxidase reduces such injury by catalyzing the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Lactate dehydrogenase is present in a variety of cells, and its elevation in the serum is an indicator of cell injury and death.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Phospholipases decrease cellular phospholipids and promote cell membrane injury</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The free iron contributes to generation of cellular free radicals via the Fenton reaction.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hemosiderin is a storage form of iron from excess local or systemic accumulation of ferritin, and by itself does not cause cell injury until large amounts are present, as with hemochromatosis</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The onset of menstruation is orderly, programmed cell death (apoptosis) through hormonal stimuli, an example of the intrinsic (mitochondrial) apoptotic pathway</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The BCL2 gene product inhibits cellular apoptosis by binding to Apaf-1.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The BAX gene product promotes apoptosis,</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The FAS gene encodes for a cellular receptor for Fas ligand that signals apoptosis.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Lipases are activated in enzymatic fat necrosis.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Granzyme B is a serine protease found in CTLs that can directly trigger apoptosis.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>CTLs express Fas ligand on their surfaces, and when contacting Fas receptors on the target cell, the ligand can induce apoptosis by the <strong>extrinsic (death receptor–initiated) pathway.</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Endonucleases are generated following caspase activation and lead to nuclear fragmentation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The RIP1-RIP3 complex is called a necrosome</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Decreased serum albumin levels and increased prothrombin time suggest alcohol-induced hepatocyte damag</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hemosiderin is a storage form of iron that appears in tissues of the mononuclear phagocyte system (e.g., marrow, liver, spleen)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Lipofuscin is a golden brown pigment that increases with aging in cell cytoplasm, mainly in cardiac myocytes and in hepatocytes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Metastases are mass lesions that impart a tan-to-white appearance to tissues.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Amyloid is an abnormal protein derived from a variety of precursors, such as immunoglobulin light chains</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Steatosis usually occurs with ingestion of hepatotoxins, such as alcohol.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hypercalcemia can have a variety of causes, including primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism, bone destruction secondary</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because the solubility product of calcium and phosphorus must be maintained, the serum calcium is depressed, triggering increased parathyroid hormone output to increase the calcium level, which promotes calcium deposition.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The granulomas of tuberculosis have caseous necrosis with dystrophic calcification.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The X chromosome transcribes XIST, a lncRNA that binds to and represses X chromosome expression.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are noncoding RNA sequences that inhibit the translation of mRNAs</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Gene-silencing RNAs (small interfering RNAs [siRNAs]) have the same function as miRNAs, but they are produced synthetically for experimental purposes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Heterophagocytosis by macrophages requires that endocytosed vacuoles fuse with lysosomes to degrade the engulfed material.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Actin is a microfilament involved with cell movement</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cytokeratins form cytoskeletal elements of epithelial cells.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Desmin forms the scaffold in muscle cells on which actin and myosin contract.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Lamin is associated with the nuclear membrane.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>RAS proteins transduce signals from growth factor receptors, such as epidermal growth factor, that have intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity.</p>
