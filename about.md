  Hi everyone, my name David L. I am currently a PhD student at University of Mississippi Medical Center in the US. My area of study is long non-coding RNA (LncRNA) in cancer research. I am also part time data scientist and very interested in bioinformatics. 
  During my free time, I like to play the piano and enjoy cooking with my wife.
