<p class="message">
  This is TmmGeek, I love computer science, Math, prgramming and embeded system like IoT devices. 
  I experienced a very dramatic transiation academically. I received my bacholar degree from Belhaven University, a rather conservative liberal art college, then I went on to become a PhD student at University of Mississippi Medical Center. It was in my past year of college that I started to explore math and computer and fell in love with it. 

  Subsequently I quitted my PhD position and became a graduate student in Computer science at Mississippi State University. I am exploring into the fields of Artificial Intelligence, block chain and big data. I also like playing with IoT devices. 

  I like reading and building things at my free time, I also practice Wing Chun. 

  I would like to make friends with the like minded, so please leave me your message if have something interesting to share and learn from each other.
