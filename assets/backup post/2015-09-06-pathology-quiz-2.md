###Question 1

Within minutes after a bee sting, a 15 year-old girl suddenly has difficulty breathing. There is marked urticaria and marked edema of the hand that was stung. Which of the following is the best pharmacologic agent to treat these signs and symptoms?

* Penicillin 

* **Epinephrine** 

* Glucocorticoids 

* Methotrexate 

* Cyclosporine

This girl has experienced a systemic anaphylactic reaction from a type I hypersensitivity reaction. Epinephrine is the fastest acting agent to treat this life-threatening condition. Cyclosporine is used to minimize transplant rejection. Penicillin is an antibiotic that often induces a type I hypersensitivity reaction. Glucocorticoids can reduce immune reactions, although this occurs over days to weeks, not minutes. Methotrexate is useful in the treatment of graft-versus-host disease.

###Question 2


A 20 year-old man steps into an elevator full of people who are coughing and sneezing, all of whom appear to have colds or the flu. The influenza viral particles that he inhales attach to the respiratory epithelium, and viral transformation reduces the MHC class I molecules on these epithelial cells. Which of the following cells is most likely to respond to destroy these infected cells?

* **Natural killer cell** 

* Dendritic cell 

* CD4 cell 

* Neutrophil 

* Macrophage 



{% highlight liquid %}
{% raw %}
Natural killer (NK) cells have the ability to respond without prior sensitization. They carry receptors for MHC class I molecules, which inhibit their lytic function. When expression of class I MHC molecules is reduced on a cell surface by viral interference, the inhibitory receptors on NK cells do not receive a negative signal, and the targeted cell is killed. NK cells are often the first line of defense against viral infection. CD4+ cells are helper T cells that assist other cells, such as NK cells, macrophages, and B cells, in the immune response. Dendritic cells aid in antigen presentation. Mac- rophages can phagocytize necrotic cells, then process and display any foreign antigens within those cells. Neutrophils provide a nonspecific immune response, primarily to bacte- rial infections and not to intracellular viral infections.

###Question 3


A 30 year-old woman has had fever and arthralgia for the past two weeks. On physical examination, she has a temperature of 37.6 degrees C and an erythematous malar rash. Initial laboratory studies are also positive for ANAs at 1:1600 and anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies at 1:3200. Serum creatinine is markedly elevated, and serum complement levels are decreased. A VDRL test for syphilis is positive, and in vitro tests of coagulation (prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time) are prolonged. Which of the following clinical features of her illness is most likely caused by antibodies that interfere with the coagulation tests?

* Arthritis 

* Rash 

* Renal failure 

* **Recurrent thrombosis** 

* Fever 

{% highlight liquid %}
{% raw %}
This patient has clinical and serologic features of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). She also has a false-positive test result for syphilis, indicating the presence of anticardiolipin antibodies. These antibodies against phospholipid-protein complexes (antiphospholipid antibodies) also are called lupus anticoagulants because they interfere with in vitro clotting tests. In vivo, they are thrombogenic. Hence, these patients can have recurrent thrombosis. Lupus anticoagulants also can occur in the absence of SLE. The other listed options can occur in SLE, but they are not mediated by antiphospholipid antibodies.

###Question 4


A 35 year-old man has a history of mild infections of the upper respiratory tract. He also has had diarrhea for most of his life, although it was not severe enough to cause malabsorption and weight loss. After an episode of trauma with blood loss, he receives a blood transfusion and has an anaphylactic reaction. Which of the following underlying conditions best explains these findings?

* **Selective IgA deficiency** 

* DiGeorge syndrome 

* Severe combined immunodeficiency 

* HIV infection 

* Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome 



{% highlight liquid %}
{% raw %}
Patients with IgAD are at some increased risk of developing severe reactions after receiving blood products.[13, 14, 15] IgG anti-IgA antibodies may cause severe transfusion reactions if patients with IgAD are given whole blood; therefore, IgA-poor blood or washed red cells are preferred for those patients. IgA-deficient patients with immunoglobulin E (IgE)–class anti-IgA antibodies are at risk for anaphylaxis if they receive blood or intravenous immunoglobulin, but this situation is extremely rare. Individuals with such an unusual profile should receive only low IgA intravenous immunoglobulin preparations. However, caution must be used when administering IGIV to patients with IgAD if their anti-IgA status is unknown.

###Question 5


Laboratory tests are ordered for two hospitalized patients. During the phleobotomy procedure, the Vacutainer tubes drawn from these patients are mislabeled. One of the patients receives a blood transfusion later that day. Within one hour after the transfusion of RBCs begins, the patient becomes tachycardic and hypotensive and passes pink-colored urine. Which of the following statements best describes how the reaction is mediated?

* Mast cell degranulation 

* Release of tumor necrosis factor alpha into the circulation 

* Antigen-antibody compex deposition in glomeruli 

* Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity by natural killer cells 

* **Complement-mediated lysis of RBCs** 


{% highlight liquid %}
{% raw %}
A major transfusion reaction results from a type II hypersensitivity reaction. The patient’s serum contains natu- rally occurring antibodies to the incompatible donor RBCs. They attach to the donor RBCs and induce complement activation that results in generation of the C5-9 membrane attack complex. Major transfusion reactions are rare, and

###Question 6


A 40 year-old laboratory technician accidentally injects a chemical into his skin. The next day, he notes that an area of erythematous, indurated skin is forming around the site of injection. Two days later, the induration measures 10mm in diameter. A microscopic section from this area, with immunostaining using an antibody to CD4, shows many positive lymphocytes. Which of the following immunologic reactions is most consistent with this appearance?

* Systemic anaphylaxis 

* **Delayed-type hypersensitivity** 

* Graft-versus-host disease 

* Serum sickness 

* Arthus reaction 


{% highlight liquid %}
{% raw %}
Perivascular accumulation of T cells, particularly CD4+ cells, is typical of delayed hypersensitivity skin reactions, driven by a TH1 response mediated largely by release of the cytokine interleukin-2. Systemic anaphylaxis typically occurs within minutes after an encounter with the antigen. Systemic and localized immune complex diseases (serum sickness and Arthus reactions) are type III hypersensitivity reactions; they often exhibit vasculitis. Graft-versus-host disease is characterized by epidermal apoptosis and rash.

###Question 7


A 45 year-old woman has had a burning sensation with increasing blurring of vision for the past five years. On physical examination, she has keratoconjunctivitis. Atrophy of the oral mucosa, with buccal mucosal ulcerations, is also present. A biopsy specimen of the lip shows marked lymphocytic and plasma cell infiltration of the minor salivary glands. Which of the following antibodies is most likely to be identified on laboratory testing?

* Anti-double-standed DNA 

* Anti-centromere 

* Scl-70 

* **SS-B** 

* Jo-1 


{% highlight liquid %}
{% raw %}
Sjogren syndrome primarily involves salivary and lacrimal glands. Antibodies to SS-B are found in the majority of these patients. Anti–double-stranded DNA is a specific autoantibody for systemic lupus erythematosus. Anticen- tromere antibody is seen most often in limited systemic sclerosis, whereas anti–DNA topoisomerase most often ap- pears with diffuse systemic sclerosis. U1-RNP is a marker for mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD).

###Question 8


A 22 year-old man has had a urethral discharge for the past week. A culture of the exudate from the urethra grows Neisseria gonorrhoeae. He is treated with penicillin G, but within minutes after injection, he develops itching and erythema of the skin. This is quickly followed by severe respiratory difficulty with wheezing and stridor. Which of the following immunoglobulins has most likely become attached to the penicillin G and mast cells to produce these symptoms?

* IgG 

* IgD 

* IgA 

* **IgE** 

* Ig M 


{% highlight liquid %}
{% raw %}
This patient is experiencing a systemic anaphylactic reaction, a form of type I hypersensitivity. IgE is bound to mast cells, after previous sensitization, so that a repeat encounter with the antigen results in mast cell degranulation and the release of mediators, such as histamine, which lead to anaphylaxis. IgE also is important in mediating more localized inflammatory reactions such as allergic rhinitis (hay fever). Other immunoglobulins do not bind so readily to mast cells.

###Question 9


A 37 year-old man who is HIV positive has noticed multiple 0.5 to 1.2 cm plaque-like, reddish-purple skin lesions on his face, trunk, and extremities. Some of the larger lesions appear to be nodular. These lesions have appeared over the past six months and have slowly enlarged. Molecular analysis of the spindle cells found in these skin lesions is likely to reveal a genome of which of the following viruses?

* Cytomegalovirus 

* HIV-1 

* Adenovirus 

* Epstein-Barr virus 

* Human herpesvirus-8 

{% highlight liquid %}
{% raw %}
Human herpesvirus-8 has been associated with Kaposi sarcoma and can be acquired as a sexually transmitted disease. Kaposi sarcoma is a complication of AIDS. Individuals with HIV infection can be infected with various viruses, including Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV), but these have no etiologic association with Kaposi sarcoma. EBV is a factor in the development of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and CMV can cause colitis or retinitis or can be disseminated. Hepatitis B virus can be seen in HIV-infected patients as well, particularly patients with a risk factor of injection drug use. Adenovirus, which, although rare, can be seen in HIV-infected individuals, tends to be a respiratory or gastrointestinal infection.

###Question 10


A 31 year-old woman has had increasing edema, chest pain, and an erythematous rash for the past six months. Laboratory studies show increasing serum creatinine, and urinalysis shows proteinuria with RBC casts. If present, which of the following antibodies is most helpful in diagosing this patient's condition?

* Jo-1 

* Anti-HLA-B27 

* Anti-Sm 

* Anti-centromere 

* Scl-70 

{% highlight liquid %}
{% raw %}
Anti-Sm and anti–double-stranded DNA are specific for systemic lupus erythematosus. Anti-Sm is present in only 25% of cases, however. Scl-70 is a marker for diffuse systemic sclerosis. Jo-1 is most specific for polymyositis. HLA-B27 is seen in ankylosing spondylitis. Anticentromere antibody is seen most often with limited scleroderma.
