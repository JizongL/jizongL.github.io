acute nonspecific lymphadenitis

Sinus Histiocytosis. This reactive pattern is characterized by distention and prominence of the lymphatic sinusoids, owing to a marked hypertrophy of lining endothelial cells and an infiltrate of macrophages (histiocytes). It often is encountered in lymph nodes draining cancers and may represent an immune response to the tumor or its products.


## Laboratory Findings 

ALL 

* The white cell count is variable; it may be greater than 100,000 cells/μL but in about half of the patients is less than 10,000 cells/μL. Anemia is almost always present, and the platelet count usually is below 100,000/μL. Neutropenia is another common finding.

## Genetic Features. 

ALL

* non-random karyotypic abnormalities. 

* common in child- hood pre-B cell tumors are hyperdiploidy 

* a cryptic (12;21) translocation involving the TEL1 and AML1 genes

* 25% of adult pre-B cell tumors harbor the (9;22) translocation involving the ABL and BCR genes

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and small lympho- cytic lymphoma (SLL)

* exceeds 4000 cells/μL, the patient is diagnosed with CLL; if it does not, a diagnosis of SLL is made.

* CLL/SLL is much less common in Asia.

* CLL is more common than SLL in the west. 

* immune dysregulation. 

* accumulation of CLL/SLL cells suppresses normal B cell function(unclear mechanism), -> hypogammaglobulinemia

* proliferation centers

* chromosomal translocations are rare.

* Approximately 50% of tumors have karyotypic abnormalities, the most common of which are trisomy 12 and deletions of chromosomes 11, 13, and 17.

Follicular l􏰎ym􏰁phom􏰁a

* Express BCL2

* (14;18) translocation, fuses the BCL2 on chromosome 18 to IgH locus on chromosome 14. 

* nodular proliferation

* predominant neoplastic cells are slightly larger than resting lymphocytes that have angular “cleaved” nuclei with prominent indentations and linear infoldings (Fig. 11–16, B). The nuclear chromatin is coarse and condensed, and nucleoli are indistinct. These small, cleaved cells are mixed with variable numbers of larger cells with vesicular chromatin, several nucleoli, and modest amounts of cytoplasm. In most tumors, large cells are a minor component of the **overall cellularity**, mitoses are infrequent, and single necrotic cells (cells undergoing apoptosis) are not seen. These features help to distinguish follicular lymphoma from **follicular hyperplasia**, in which mitoses and apoptosis are prominent.

Mantle Cell l􏰎ym􏰁phom􏰁a

* Mantle cell lymphoma is composed of cells resembling the naive B cells found in the mantle zones of normal lymphoid follicles.

* lymphomatoid polyposis. (11;14) translocation

* that fuses the cyclin D1 gene to the IgH locus.

* distinguished from CLL/SLL by the absence of proliferation centers and the presence of cyclin D1 protein.


Diffuse 􏰂large B􏰀 Cell 􏰂lymphoma

* most common type of lymphoma in adults, 50% of NHLs. 

* About one third of tumors have rearrangements of the BCL6 gene,located on 3q27, and an even higher fraction of tumors have activating point mutations in the BCL6 promotor. resulted in increased levels of BCL6 protein. transcriptional regulator of gene expression in germinal center B cells. 

* Another 30% of tumors have a (14,18) translocation involving the BCL2 gene that results in overexpression of BCL2 protein. loss-of-function mutations in genes encoding histone acetyl transferases.

* Aneuploidy and high S phase 

Burkitt lymphoma 

* highly associated with translocations involving the MYC gene on chromosome 8. Most translocations fuse MYC with the IgH gene on chromo- some 14, but variant translocations involving the κ and λ light chain loci on chromosomes 2 and 22, respectively, are also observed.

* “starry sky” pattern.

* usually is present in the jaw or abdomen

Muliple Myeloma and Related Plasma Cell Tumors

* The plasma cell neoplasms can be divided into six major variants: (1) multiple myeloma, (2) solitary plasmacytoma, (3) lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, (4) heavy-chain disease, (5) primary amyloidosis, and (6) MGUS. The focus here is on the most important of these disorders, multiple myeloma and lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, with a brief discussion of the other disorders.

Multiple Myeloma

* It principally involves the bone marrow and usually is associated with lytic lesions throughout the skeletal system.

* M protein produced by myeloma cells is IgG (60%), followed by IgA (20% to 25%); only rarely are IgM, IgD, or IgE M proteins observed. In the remaining 15% to 20% of cases, the plasma cells produce only κ or λ light chains.

* dysregulation of D cyclins is common in multiple myeloma.

* cytokine interleukin 6 (IL-6) support proliferation of myeloma

* Patients with myeloma are immunosuppressed.

* myeloma cells interfere with the function of normal plasma cells, leading to defects in antibody production.

* Renal dysfunction is a common, serious problem in myeloma. Proteinaceous casts, formed in the distal convoluted tubules and the collecting ducts. 
The casts consist mostly of Bence Jones proteins along with variable amounts of complete immunoglobulins, Tamm-Horsfall protein, and albumin

* hypercalcemia

Solitary Plasmacytoma

* involving the skeleton or the soft tissues

* occur in the same locations as does multiple myeloma and usually progress to full-blown multiple myeloma over a period of 5 to 10 years

* IL-LB and IL-6 stimulate RANK-ligand.

Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) 

* the term applied to an asymptomatic monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance(MGUS).

* a precursor lesion with a tendency to evolve to multiple myeloma.

Lymphoplasmacytic Lymphoma

* Waldenström macroglobulinemia

Heavy-Chain Disease

* IgA heavy-chain disease

* a variant of extranodal marginal zone lymphoma

Primary Amyloidosis

Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma 

* Waldenström macroglobulinemia, the size of macroglobulins cause the blood to become viscous.

* Visual impairment

* Cryoglobulinemia

### Hodgkin lymphoma 

Basic facts



* “classic” RS cells are common in the **mixed-cellularity subtype**, uncommon in the **nodular sclerosis subtype**, and rare in the lymphocyte- predominance subtype; in these latter two subtypes, other characteristic RS cell variants predominate.

[Peripheral T Cell Lymphomas]()

## immunotyping


ALL

* Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT), an enzyme specifically expressed in pre-B and pre-T cells, is present in more than 95% of cases. Further subtyping of ALL into pre-B and pre-T cell types relies on stains for lineage-specific markers, such as CD19 (B cell) and CD3 (T cell).

CLL/SLL 

* a neoplasm of mature B cells expressing the pan-B cell markers CD19, CD20, and CD23 and surface immunoglobulin heavy and light chains. 

* tumor cells also express CD5

Folicular Lymphoma

* These tumors express pan-B cell markers (CD19 and CD20), CD10, and BCL6, a transcription factor required for the generation of germinal center B cells.

* Follicular lymphoma mainly occurs in adults older than 50 years of age and affects males and females equally.

Mantle cell lymphoma

* The tumor cells usually coexpress surface IgM and IgD, pan-B cell antigens (CD19 and CD20), and CD5.

Diffuse 􏰂large B􏰀 Cell 􏰂lymphoma

* These mature B cell tumors express pan-B cell antigens, such as CD19 and CD20. Many also express surface IgM and/or IgG. Other antigens (e.g., CD10, BCL2) are variably expressed.

Burkitt lymphoma 

* These B cell tumors express surface IgM, the pan-B cell markers CD19 and CD20, and the germinal center B cell markers CD10 and BCL6.

Hodgkin lymphoma 

* Typical RS cells and variants have a characteristic immunophenotype, as they express CD15 and CD30 and fail to express CD45(common leukocyte antigen)
The immunophenotype of lacunar variants is identical to that of other RS cells found in classical subtypes.

* L&H variants express B cell markers (e.g., CD20) and usually fail to express CD15 and CD30.


Hairy Cell leukemia

* The tumor cells express pan-B cell markers (CD19 and CD20), surface immunoglobulin, and CD11c and CD103; the latter two antigens are not present on most other B cell tumors, making them diagnostically useful.

Adult T Cell Leukemia/Lymphoma

* In addition to CD4, the leukemic cells express high levels of CD25, the IL-2 receptor α chain.

## Prognosis

ALL

* 2 to 10 years of age have the best prognosis
 
* worse outcomes includes male gender; age younger than 2 or older than 10 years; a high leukocyte count at diagnosis; and molecular evidence of persistent disease on day 28 of treatment.

* good prognosis - chromosomal aberrations (such as the t[12;21] and hyperdiploidy) are common in the 2- to 10-year age group

* bad prognosis - rearrangements of the gene MLL or the presence of a BCR-ABL fusion gene, both associated with poor outcomes in B cell tumors, are most common in children younger than 2 years of age and adult

CLL/SLL

* lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly are present in 50% to 60% of patients.

* half has Hypogammaglobulinemia (susceptibility to bacterial infections)

* autoimmune hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia (less common)

Follicular lymphoma

* painless, generalized lymphadenopathy.

* not curable

* therapy with cytotoxic drugs and rituximab (anti-CD20 antibody) is reserved for those with bulky, symptomatic disease.

Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma

* Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV), also called human herpesvirus type 8 (HHV-8), is associated with rare primary effusion lym- phomas,

* Mediastinal large B cell lymphoma occurs most often in young women and shows a predilec- tion for spread to abdominal viscera and the central nervous system.
