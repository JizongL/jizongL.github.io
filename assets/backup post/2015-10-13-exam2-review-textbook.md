### Acute Leukemias in general

oncogenic tyrosine kinases activate RAS and its two downstream signaling arms, the PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathways 

B-ALL and CML -> BCR-ABL fusion gene (9,22) translocation, philiadelphia chromosome. 

some T-ALLs -> NUP214-ABL (similar to BCR-ABL)

Acute leukemias have the following characteristics:


a lack of CD7 expression could insinuate mycosis fungoides (MF) or Sezary syndrome (SS).



#### Laboratory Findings in Acute Leukemias

(WBC count) variable; maybe > 100,000 cells/μL, in 50% of patient, < 10,000 cells/μL. 

Anemia is almost always present

platelet count 00,000/μL

Neutropenia 


#### ALL Immunophenotypic Features

Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) -> pre-B and pre-T cells

 Further subtyping of ALL -> lineage-specific markers, such as CD19 (B cell) and CD3 (T cell).

#### B lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma: Immunophenotype


* CD19 – pan-B-cell marker

* CD10  - Common Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Antigen (CALLA), most cases

* CD34 – stem cell marker, most cases

* TdT – nearly all cases

* Cytoplasmic IgM heavy chain (μ chain)

- Only in the more mature “late pre-B” cases

- Otherwise, ALL are negative for Ig

- Distinguishes ALL from mature B-cell leukemia/lymphoma


#### T lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma: Immunophenotype

* TdT – many cases

* Most T-cell antigens positive: CD1a, CD2, cytoplasmic CD3, CD5, and CD7

* CD1a - T-cell markers often negative: surface CD3, CD4 and CD8

* CD4 and CD8 often negative in more immature forms

* CD4 and CD8 often positive in more mature forms

#### Leukocyte alkaline phosphatase

Leukocyte alkaline phosphatase (LAP) is found within mature white blood cells. White blood cell levels of LAP can help in the diagnosis of certain conditions.

Higher levels are seen in polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocytosis (ET), primary myelofibrosis (PM), and the leukemoid reaction.
Lower levels are found in chronic myelogenous leukemia(CML), paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML).


#### CLL/SLL 

circulating  nucleated  red  cells  could  stem  from  premature  release  of  progenitors  in  the  face  of  severe anemia

The most promising new therapy is BTK inhibitors, described earlier.



### blood count note

observing CBC and blood count

platlet count -> thrombocytopenia 

Normal bone marrow -> exclude acute lymphoid or myeloid leukemia

reduction in RBCs, WBCs, and platelet production -> aplastic anemia

band neutrophil -> left shift -> inflammatory condition
