* a plasma cell neoplasm commonly associated with lytic bone lesions, hypercalcemia, renal failure, and acquired immune abnormalities. 

* It principally involves the bone marrow and usually is associated with lytic lesions throughout the skeletal system.

* M protein produced is IgG (60%), followed by IgA (20% to 25%); rarely are IgM, IgD, or IgE M proteins observed. In the remaining 15% to 20% of cases, the plasma cells produce only κ or λ light chains.

#### Pathogenesis

* frequent rearrangements involving the IgH locus and various proto-oncogenes
